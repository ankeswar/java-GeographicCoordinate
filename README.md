GeographicCoordinate
====================

GeographicCoordinate is a simple Java library for representing latitude and longitude, and for calculating distances.

Features:

* Unlike using floating-point primitives, GeographicCoordinate enforces automatic range checking:  objects can never have invalid values.
* Coordinates can be manipulated in floating-point form or as degrees, minutes and seconds.
* Provides the ability to calculate the distance between two points, or for the total travel distance between an unlimited number of points.
* Backed by more than 130 unit tests

It's always gratifying to know that other people find your work useful.  If you like this library, consider letting me know at github@loverde.org.
