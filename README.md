GeographicCoordinate
====================

GeographicCoordinate is a simple Java library for representing latitude and longitude, and for calculating distances.

Features:

* Unlike using floating-point primitives, GeographicCoordinate enforces automatic range checking:  objects can never have invalid values.
* Coordinates can be manipulated in floating-point form or as degrees, minutes and seconds.
* Provides the ability to calculate the distance between two coordinates, or for the total travel distance between an unlimited number of points.


If you find this library useful, I'd love to hear from you.  I can be reached at github@loverde.org.
